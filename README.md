#Testing Java 8 Features

This repository shows example implementations of the new Java 8 features

## Lambdas

[Usining Lambdas](https://github.com/jethroo/testing_java8_features/blob/master/src/de/jethroo/JavaLambda.java) as learned from [Oracle Lambda Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html). Here a [Filter](https://github.com/jethroo/testing_java8_features/blob/master/src/de/jethroo/JavaLambda.java#L37) is applied in a collection
of Items which then is [mapped](https://github.com/jethroo/testing_java8_features/blob/master/src/de/jethroo/JavaLambda.java#L40) (applying a function on the filered items) to finally [consume](https://github.com/jethroo/testing_java8_features/blob/master/src/de/jethroo/JavaLambda.java#L42) the results. All this can be done using the [Collection API](https://github.com/jethroo/testing_java8_features/blob/master/src/de/jethroo/JavaLambda.java#L43) which accepts lambda parameters.
